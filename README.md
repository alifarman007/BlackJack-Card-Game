<h2>Description</h2>
Blackjack (formerly black jack and vingt-un) is a casino banking game. It is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. It uses decks of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as "twenty-one". This family of card games also includes the European games vingt-et-un and pontoon, and the Russian game Ochko [ru].[2] Blackjack players do not compete against each other. The game is a comparing card game where each player competes against the dealer.
Blackjack is an incredibly popular, exciting and easy card game to play. The object is to have a hand with a total value higher than the dealer’s without going over 21. Kings, Queens, Jacks and Tens are worth a value of 10. An Ace has the value of 1 or 11. The remaining cards are counted at face value.
